# Dashboard Mesjid

## Description

Welcome to the Masjid Asy-Syahid website! This project aims to modernize the experience of participating in mosque activities, promote awareness and understanding of Islam among the general public, and encourage active engagement in religious development.

Although the website is still in its development phase, I have completed the main features that you can use. Here are the available features:

1. **Prayer Schedule**: Find a list of prayer schedules regularly to help you perform your worship more consistently (currently only available for the Bekasi region).

2. **Events and Religious Gatherings**: Access information about events and religious gatherings held at the mosque, allowing you to engage in meaningful activities.

3. **Donations**: Support the mosque by making donations through bank transfers or contributing material goods for the common good.

4. **Registration and Login**: To participate in events or study groups, you need to log in first. If you don't have an account yet, you can easily register.
